		<h2>How do they work?</h2>
		<p>Although there are several different types of vaporizers, they all function in a similar way. Generally a vape consists of a battery, a tank or cartridge to store the nicotine liquid (also known as e-juice or e-liquid), an atomizer or cartomizer, and a mouthpiece for the user to inhale the vapor. The e-liquid is delivered to the atomizer/cartomizer which vaporizes the liquid producing a vapor containing nicotine.
